# The Cap'n's Graph

This repository contains a [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/)
schema for graphs, along with tools for working with this format.

*Status*: Schema written, converter from edge-list format for the
particular implementation I need done.

**Installing the Binaries:**
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/emallson/capngraph.git --features bins
```

Statically-linked release binaries are also available on Github.

**Linking to the Library:**
```toml
[dependencies]
capngraph = { version = "0.3.1", git = "https://github.com/emallson/capngraph.git" }
```

## Motivation

Do you know how many undocumented graph formats there are in the wild?
Go count them; I don't expect you back before I finish my doctorate.

Most of them follow a pretty simple convention: first line is some
metadata (typically number of nodes / number of edges or a comment)
followed by one line for each edge in the graph. This *seems*
straightforward, except for all the subtle ways that they vary (e.g.
some allow comments, some don't). For one recent project, I *manually*
converted several different formats to a single uniform one. Not
pleasant.

This is compounded with the fact that these files are horribly large
for large datasets: 2-4x larger than necessary since the numbers are
textual (1 byte per digit) instead of binary (4 bytes per number).
They also take an inordinate amount of time to read in text format: a
50GB dataset takes almost 15m to parse into a graph in one
implementation, while a (custom, undocumented, ugly) binary
implementation takes under a minute.<sup>*</sup>

What *I* want is a binary format that is documented, easy-to-parse,
and extensible. Cap'n Proto (successor to Protobuf) fits the bill.

<sup>*</sup> I haven't done formal benchmarks on this and probably
won't. It is readily apparent that reading more data takes longer,
which is magnified by the additional parsing and converting necessary
for the text format.
